**Smart Wi-Fi access control system** powered by Raspberry Pi — built for cafés, events, and co-working spaces.

## 🔧 What It Does
- Captive portal with phone-number login
- Time-limited internet access (e.g., 3 hours)
- Discord alerts when new devices connect

## 💡 Why I Built It
To help small businesses offer **secure, limited, and trackable internet access** without expensive enterprise tools.

## 🖥️ Tech Used
- Python (Flask, sockets)
- HTML/CSS (UI for portal and dashboard)
- Raspberry Pi (hosted hotspot + systemd)
- dnsmasq, iptables, hostapd
- Discord Webhook + Bot
